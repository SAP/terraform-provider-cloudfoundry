# Terraform Provider for {{.RenderedProviderName}}

~> **This provider is deprecated and no longer maintained** 
We have moved the Terraform Provider for Cloud Foundry to the [Cloud Foundry Foundation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/terraform-provider-cloudfoundry).
</br></br>Going forward, we recommend users to switch to the Terraform Provider for Cloud Foundry which is now officially released from the Cloud Foundry Foundation [registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudfoundry/cloudfoundry/latest). It is a drop in replacement for this provider and has been released as GA there.
</br></br>All active development will be continued in the Cloud Foundry Foundation Repo henceforth.
</br>Please use the new repository to create issues and participate in discussions and the new registry for documentation.

**Note** 

All parameter values for the provider can be injected by setting environment variables `CF_API_URL`, `CF_USER`, `CF_PASSWORD`, `CF_ORIGIN`, `CF_CLIENT_ID`, `CF_CLIENT_SECRET`, `CF_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `CF_REFRESH_TOKEN`.
Alternatively, one can even log in to their CF landscape via CF-CLI and the provider will pick the credentials from the config.json present in CF Home in case no attributes are given in the provider block or if no environment variables are set.

## Custom User-Agent Information

By default, the underlying Cloud Foundry client used by the Terraform Cloud Foundry Provider creates requests with User-Agent headers that include information about Terraform and Cloud Foundry Terraform provider versions. To add more details to the User-Agent headers, the `CF_APPEND_USER_AGENT` environment variable can be set, and its value will be directly added to HTTP requests. E.g.,

```bash
% export CF_APPEND_USER_AGENT="Optional_Extra_Information"
```

## Get Started

If you're not familiar with Terraform yet, see the [Fundamentals](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cli) section with a lot of helpful tutorials. 

## Best Practices

For the best experience using the {{.RenderedProviderName}} provider, we recommend applying the common best practices for Terraform adoption as described in the Hashicorp documentation. For example, see [Phases of Terraform Adoption](https://developer.hashicorp.com/well-architected-framework/operational-excellence/operational-excellence-terraform-maturity).
