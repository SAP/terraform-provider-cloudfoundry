# Terraform Provider for {{.RenderedProviderName}}

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

{{ if .HasExample -}}
## Example Usage

{{tffile .ExampleFile}}
{{- end }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

**Note** 

All parameter values for the provider can be injected by setting environment variables `CF_API_URL`, `CF_USER`, `CF_PASSWORD`, `CF_ORIGIN`, `CF_CLIENT_ID`, `CF_CLIENT_SECRET`.
Alternatively, one can even log in to their CF landscape via CF-CLI and the provider will pick the credentials from the config.json present in CF Home in case no attributes are given in the provider block or if no environment variables are set.

## Custom User-Agent Information

By default, the underlying Cloud Foundry client used by the Terraform Cloud Foundry Provider creates requests with User-Agent headers that include information about Terraform and Cloud Foundry Terraform provider versions. To add more details to the User-Agent headers, the `CF_APPEND_USER_AGENT` environment variable can be set, and its value will be directly added to HTTP requests. E.g.,

```bash
% export CF_APPEND_USER_AGENT="Optional_Extra_Information"
```
