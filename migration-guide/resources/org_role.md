# cloudfoundry_org_role 

Provides a Cloud Foundry resource for assigning org roles. Roles of `type` are assigned to the individual user. V3 api has clear well-defined separate API's for roles and users and the innumerous endpoints for different roles at both space and org level have been removed. One just needs to specify the necessary `type` now for a particular user as a query while specifying the role. For specifying multiple role types for multiple users, one can create multiple resources now.
