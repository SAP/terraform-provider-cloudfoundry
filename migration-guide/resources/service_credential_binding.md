# cloudfoundry_service_credential_binding  

Provides a resource for managing service credential bindings in Cloud Foundry. Combines [`cloudfoundry_service_key`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/terraform-provider-cloudfoundry/blob/main/docs/resources/service_key.md) in the community provider and app service binding to resemble service credential binding resource as provided in V3 API.
