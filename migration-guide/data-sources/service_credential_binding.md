# cloudfoundry_service_credential_binding

Gets information on Service Credential Bindings for a given service instance. Combines [`cloudfoundry_service_key`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/terraform-provider-cloudfoundry/blob/main/docs/data-sources/service_key.md) in the community provider and querying for app app credential_bindings.

| Attribute name | SAP Cloud Foundry Provider (new)|  Community Cloud Foundry Provider (old) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | ðŸŸ¢ | ðŸ”µ | Since `cloudfoundry_service_key` resource in community provider can only query for service keys and not app bindings, name has been made optional now as app bindings need not have names. |
| app | ðŸŸ¢ | ðŸ”´ | One can query for a specific app credential_binding by providing its GUID |
| credential_bindings | ðŸŸ  | ðŸ”´ | - |
| id | ðŸ”´ | ðŸŸ  |  The current provider returns multiple credential bindings if available for the given `service_instance` unlike the community provider where we only search for a particular service key by its `name`. Therefore, one can refer the `id` of the respective binding in the `credential_bindings` attribute. |
| credentials |  ðŸ”´ |ðŸŸ | Since multiple credential bindings can be obtained, the credential details can be obtained in the respective bindings in the `credential_binding` attribute of `credential_bindings` output. |
