# cloudfoundry_service_route_binding (Resource)

Service route bindings are relations between a service instance and a route.

Not all service instances support route binding. In order to bind to a managed service instance, the service instance should be created from a service offering that has requires route forwarding (requires=[route_forwarding]). In order to bind to a user-provided service instance, the service instance must have route_service_url set.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudfoundry_service_route_binding" "srb7" {
  service_instance = "3a8588f9-f846-444f-ab9e-48282f06449b"
  route            = "3966c2fb-d84d-462d-82a5-a81cf7cdab20"
  labels           = { "hi" : "fi" }
}
```
