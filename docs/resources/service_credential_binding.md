# cloudfoundry_service_credential_binding (Resource)

Service credential bindings are used to make the details of the connection to a service instance available to an app or a developer.
		Service credential bindings can be of type app or key.
		A service credential binding is of type app when it is a binding between a service instance and an application Not all services support this binding, as some services deliver value to users directly without integration with an application. Field broker_catalog.features.bindable from service plan of the service instance can be used to determine if it is bindable.
		A service credential binding is of type key when it only retrieves the details of the service instance and makes them available to the developer.

## Example Usage

```terraform

  type             = "app"
  name             = "hifi"
  service_instance = "e9ec29ca-993d-42e2-9c5b-cb17b1972cce"
  app              = "ec6ac2b3-fb79-43c4-9734-000d4299bd59"
