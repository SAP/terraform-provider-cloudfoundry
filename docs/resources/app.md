# cloudfoundry_app (Resource)

Provides a Cloud Foundry resource to manage applications.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cloudfoundry = {
      source = "sap/cloudfoundry"
    }
    zipper = {
      source = "ArthurHlt/zipper"
    }
  }
}
provider "cloudfoundry" {}

provider "zipper" {}

resource "zipper_file" "fixture" {
  source      = "https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/cf-sample-app-nodejs.git"
  output_path = "/Users/I524895/go/src/github.com/SAP/terraform-provider-cloudfoundry/examples/resources/cloudfoundry_app/cf-sample-app-nodejs.zip"
}
