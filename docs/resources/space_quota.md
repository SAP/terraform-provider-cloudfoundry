Provides a Cloud Foundry resource to manage space quota definitions.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cloudfoundry_space_quota" "my_space_quota" {
  name                     = "tf-test-do-not-delete"
  allow_paid_service_plans = true
  instance_memory          = 2048
  total_memory             = 51200
  total_app_instances      = 110
  total_routes             = 50
  total_services           = 200
  total_service_keys       = 120
  total_app_tasks          = 10
  total_route_ports        = 5
  total_app_log_rate_limit = 1000
  org                      = "ca721b24-e24d-4171-83e1-1ef6bd836b38"
  spaces                   = ["3bc20dc4-1870-4835-8308-dda2d766e61e"]

- `total_app_log_rate_limit` (Number) Maximum log rate allowed for all the started processes and running tasks in bytes/second.
- `total_app_tasks` (Number) Maximum tasks allowed per app.
- `total_memory` (Number) Maximum memory usage allowed.
