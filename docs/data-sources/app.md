# cloudfoundry_app (Data Source)

Gets information on a Cloud Foundry application.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cloudfoundry = {
      source = "sap/cloudfoundry"
    }
  }
}
provider "cloudfoundry" {}

data "cloudfoundry_app" "http-bin-server" {
  name  = "cf-nodejs"
  space = "tf-space-1"
  org   = "PerformanceTeamBLR"
}

output "id" {
  value = data.cloudfoundry_app.http-bin-server.id
}

output "name" {
  value = data.cloudfoundry_app.http-bin-server.name
}
output "environment" {
  value = data.cloudfoundry_app.http-bin-server.environment
}
output "instances" {
  value = data.cloudfoundry_app.http-bin-server.instances
}
output "memory" {
  value = data.cloudfoundry_app.http-bin-server.memory
}
output "disk_quota" {
  value = data.cloudfoundry_app.http-bin-server.disk_quota
}
output "routes" {
  value = data.cloudfoundry_app.http-bin-server.routes
}
output "buildpacks" {
  value = data.cloudfoundry_app.http-bin-server.buildpacks
}
